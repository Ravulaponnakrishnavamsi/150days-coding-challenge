Today, as part of my 150 Days of DSA Challenge, I worked on the Zigzag Conversion problem on LeetCode. This problem required careful handling of string traversal, indexing, and pattern simulation to efficiently construct the zigzag format.

Solving it helped strengthen my understanding of string manipulation, edge case handling, and space–time trade-offs, which are essential for writing clean and optimized solutions.

Making steady progress and continuing to build strong problem-solving fundamentals.
